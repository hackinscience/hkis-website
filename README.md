# How to contribute


## Requirements

This project requires Python 3.6 at least.


## Install

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
./manage.py migrate
./manage.py loaddata initial  # To get some users and exercises
# (Initial data can be updated using:
   ./manage.py dumpdata -e contenttypes -e auth.Permission -e sessions.session > website/fixtures/initial.json)
./manage.py createsuperuser
./manage.py runserver
```

To also run the moulinette, you'll need to install `firejail` and `redis` then run:

```
celery -A hkis worker
```


## Translations

Templates are translated using django `makemessages` and `compilemessages` commands:

```
$ ./manage.py makemessages --locale fr
$ ./manage.py makemessages --locale fr --domain djangojs
# Edit the .po files
$ ./manage.py compilemessages
```

Exercises (title and wording) are translated via the admin (or the
API), we use django-modeltranslation.


## How does the checker bot work?

The answers are load-balanced to correction workers using Celery, so
you can have multiple machines dedicated to correct loads of answers.

Once received by a worker the worker runs two things:

- An optional `pre_check.py` script, that sets-up anything specific
  for this answers (required files and directories, translations,
  whatever is needed).

- A `check.py` script is then started in a sandbox (no internet
  connectivity, restricted filesystem, CPU, memory usage, â€¦).
  This is the script that check the student answer, the protocol is
  simple: if the script exits with non-zero, then then answer is
  wrong. And what's been printed (both stdout and stderr) is
  displayed, as Markdown, to the student. If the answer is right and
  nothing is printed, a default congratulation message is used.

Both `pre_check.py` and `check.py` are in Python, but they're not
limited to check for Python answers, if you want to check for shell
script or C, or whatever, the `check.py` can use `subprocess` to run
the answer script, or compile the answer code, or whatever needed.
