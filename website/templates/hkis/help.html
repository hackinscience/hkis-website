# Getting help

## Report a bug on hackinscience

If you found an issue in an exercise, or the website, please either:

- Fill a bug [in our bugtracker](https://framagit.org/hackinscience/hkis-website/issues).
- Send me an email: [julien@palard.fr](mailto:julien@palard.fr).


## Get help from the Python community

The Python community is known to be friendly and welcoming, don't
hesitate to ask for help! Most of us are using freenode IRC channels
to talk.


### How to connect to IRC?

There's a nice web client on: [https://kiwi.freenode.net](https://kiwi.freenode.net).

Pick a `Login` and a channel (see common Python IRC Channels
below). If you don't have a NickServ account (or don't know what it
is), don't check the "I have a password" box.


### How to ask a question?

Don't ask to ask, just ask.

Be polite and respectfull.

Be patient too: We're not always watching our screens for new
messages, it can take 15mn for someone to notice a new message, like
when you send an email.

The author of HackInScience is `mdk` on Freenode, on various channels
but mainly on `#python-fr` (I'm French! I bake my own bread!), don't
hesitate to prefix your question with `mdk: ` so I notice it faster.


### IRC Channels

There's multiple channels related to Python on freenode, on different
topics and different languages, mainly:

- `#python`: the main one, but needs a freenode account

And many variations around languages and topics:

- `##python-friendly`: like #python, but friendlier.
- `##python.pl`
