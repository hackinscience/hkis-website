### Personal informations

When registering and using the Hackinscience platform, we store some
informations about you:

- Your username, maybe your email if you gave it at registration time.
- All the exercises you did, when you did them, what you submitted, what the bot answered.

Why do we store all your submissions?

- To display ✓ and ✗ marks near exercises so you know which one you
  succeeded and which one to do.
- So you can find them back tomorrow.
- Compute some statistics to spot which exercises are too hard to order them better or
  introduce intermediate/easier ones.

If you want to correct an information we've got about you, delete
it, or if you'd like all the data about you conveniently archived for
offline reading, feel free to send a mail to *team at hackinscience dot org*
or ask any member of [the team]({% url 'team' %}).
