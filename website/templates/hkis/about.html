<h1>About Hackinscience</h1>
<h2>Hackinscience, the online platform</h2>
<p>
  The Hackinscience platform is
  an <a href="http://framagit.org/hackinscience/">open-source</a>
  exercise repository we created for the physical yearly course at
  the CRI. It remains opened the whole year, and everyone can use it
  to help in teaching or learning Python.
</p>

<h3>You're a teacher?</h3>
<p>
  If you're a teacher, you can ask by email at team at hackinscience
  dot org for a teacher account, we'll bind you to your class students
  so you can follow their individual progression.

<p>
  Don't hesitate to drop us an email at team at hackinscience dot org
  and we'll discuss about it. We're based in Paris, France, but it may

<h2>Hackinscience, the Python course at CRI</h2>
<p>
  The Hackinscience week at <a href="https://cri-paris.org">le
  CRI</a> is one-week intensive Python course. Check the cri-events
  platform for the next session. We choose Python as this language
  is appreciated and ubiquitous when speaking of datascience or
  machine learning, and also a well appreciated language to start in
  programming.
</p>
<p>
  Hackinscience is intense: It spans over seven days (monday to
  sunday) and 12h per day (9 AM to 9 PM), our goal is to make you
  autonomous in Python so you can continue learning and start using
  it right after this week.
